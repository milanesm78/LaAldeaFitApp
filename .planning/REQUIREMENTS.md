## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| In-app payments | Javier handles payments outside the app (cash, Bizum) |
| Real-time chat | WhatsApp already handles trainer-client communication |
| Push notifications | Retention comes from product value, not nagging |
| Multi-trainer support | Single trainer architecture -- Javier only |
| Native mobile app | Responsive web app is sufficient |
| Social features / leaderboards | Privacy concerns, too few users for social features |
| Nutrition tracking / meal plans | Separate domain, out of scope |
| AI-generated workout plans | Trainer expertise is the value -- app is a tool, not a replacement |
| Wearable device integration | Complexity without proportional value for strength training |
| Offline mode / PWA | Standard web app; gym connectivity assumed sufficient |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from requirement dependencies -- foundation first, then training loop, then visualization, then intelligence
- [Roadmap]: PLAN-05 and PLAN-06 (cycle length and plan versioning) placed in Phase 2 with the plan builder, not deferred to Phase 4, because the data model must support immutability from the start (research flagged this as critical pitfall)
- [01-01]: Used @vitejs/plugin-react-swc for faster builds
- [01-01]: Bundled translations directly instead of HTTP lazy loading (only 2 languages)
- [01-01]: Spanish as fallback language per primary user base
- [01-01]: Zinc palette for shadcn/ui with dark/light theme CSS variables
- [01-01]: 10 granular RLS policies (separate per operation, never FOR ALL)
- [01-01]: Custom Access Token Hook for JWT role injection (not user_metadata)
- [01-02]: JWT role decoded client-side via atob(token.split('.')[1]) without external library
- [01-02]: ThemeProvider defaults to dark theme for fitness app convention
- [01-02]: Database types restructured to explicit field listings for Supabase v2 typed client compatibility
- [01-02]: Role selection via toggle buttons for better mobile UX
- [01-02]: Bottom navigation for both portals with large touch targets for gym use
- [quick-1]: Installed Supabase CLI via Homebrew for db push and config management
- [quick-1]: Used supabase config push to enable Custom Access Token Hook and disable email confirmation remotely
- [quick-1]: Added *.tsbuildinfo to .gitignore to exclude TypeScript build cache

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~[01-01]: Supabase project must be created and .env.local configured before auth features will fully work~~ **RESOLVED** (quick-1, 2026-02-25)
- [Research]: Anthropometric measurement ranges should be confirmed with Javier before Phase 3
- [Research]: Auto-progression rule specifics (which sets count, session threshold, fixed vs variable increment) must be clarified with Javier before Phase 4

# Quick Task 5: Rename javier-fitness to la-aldea-fit-app Summary

**package.json name and ThemeProvider localStorage key updated from javier-fitness to la-aldea-fit-app, completing the rebranding started in quick-4**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-06T05:31:18Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-06T05:32:26Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- package.json name field changed from "javier-fitness" to "la-aldea-fit-app"
- ThemeProvider localStorage key changed from "javier-fitness-theme" to "la-aldea-fit-app-theme"
- Verified zero remaining "javier-fitness" references in active source and config files
- Build passes successfully with new names

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Rename javier-fitness to la-aldea-fit-app in active project files** - `61e009b` (chore)

**Plan metadata:** [pending] (docs: complete quick-5 plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `package.json` - Updated name field from javier-fitness to la-aldea-fit-app
- `src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Updated STORAGE_KEY from javier-fitness-theme to la-aldea-fit-app-theme

## Decisions Made
- Accepted that existing localStorage entries under old key "javier-fitness-theme" will be orphaned; users will fall back to default dark theme (acceptable since app is pre-launch with no real users)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Full rebranding from javier-fitness to la-aldea-fit-app is now complete across GitHub repo name (quick-4), package.json, and source code (quick-5)
- No further rename tasks remain

## Self-Check: PASSED

- [x] package.json exists and contains "la-aldea-fit-app"
- [x] src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx exists and contains "la-aldea-fit-app-theme"
- [x] 5-SUMMARY.md created
- [x] Commit 61e009b verified in git log
